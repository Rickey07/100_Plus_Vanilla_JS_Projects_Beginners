## 📌 Some Confessions
- Don't focus on Css and style part as main focus of these repository is to enhance the javascript skills.
- The site is not responsive yet!


## 📌 My process

- It took me about **20 minutes** to complete this project.
- First create an array of the author and quote objects.
- Generate an random number till array last element.
- change the color on the event according to that number.


## 📌 What I Learn

👉 Learned about OOPS concepts like classes and prototypes and implemented the same in the Project.
👉 Changing Css using JS.
👉 Not focused on Css because repo is mainly of JS.
👉 The project is barely very easy it should take only 5 minutes however I've implemented the oops concept in the project that's why it has taken me 20 minutes to complete it.
